**Audio Analysis using Deep Learning**

* Audio files were analysed and features were extracted from them.
* MFCCs and their delta values were used for developing an ANN.
* Accuracy obtained is 82%.
* Steps taken to improve model score were including detla values in addition to MFCCs and tuning with different n_mfcc values.
